# duplocloud_asg_instance_refresh (Resource)

duplocloud_asg_instance_refresh triggers the instance refresh of asg in duplo. Change in refresh identifier or any other configuration field will trigger the instance refresh for the ASG instantly

 Note: Following Instance Replacement Method configurations are: 
1. Launch Before Terminating - Min Healthy Percentage = 100
2. Terminate And Launch - Max Healthy Percentage = 100

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "duplocloud_tenant" "myapp" {
  account_name = "myapp"
  plan_id      = "default"
}


resource "duplocloud_asg_instance_refresh" "name" {
  tenant_id              = duplocloud_tenant.myapp.tenant_id
  asg_name               = "asg-name"
  refresh_identifier     = "1" #any identifier values can be used
  max_healthy_percentage = 100
  min_healthy_percentage = 90
}


resource "duplocloud_asg_instance_refresh" "name" {
  asg_name                       = "asg-name"
  auto_rollback                  = true
  instance_warmup                = 300
  max_healthy_percentage         = 100
  min_healthy_percentage         = 90
  refresh_identifier             = "5"
  update_launch_template_version = "1"
  tenant_id                      = duplocloud_tenant.myapp.tenant_id

## Schema

### Required

- `asg_name` (String) The fullname of the asg
- `tenant_id` (String) The GUID of the tenant that the asg will be created in.

### Optional

- `auto_rollback` (Boolean) Automatically rollback if instance refresh fails. This can be set only if update_launch_template_version is specified
- `instance_warmup` (Number) Number of seconds until a newly launched instance is configured and ready to use. Default behavior is to use the Auto Scaling Group's health check grace period.
- `max_healthy_percentage` (Number) Amount of capacity in the Auto Scaling group that can be in service and healthy, or pending, to support your workload when an instance refresh is in place, as a percentage of the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group. Defaults to `100`.
- `min_healthy_percentage` (Number) Amount of capacity in the Auto Scaling group that must remain healthy during an instance refresh to allow the operation to continue, as a percentage of the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group. Defaults to `90`.
- `refresh_identifier` (String) To identify refresh or invoke a refresh
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `update_launch_template_version` (String) Launch template version to update

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
